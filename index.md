I am a Master's student in Computational Mechanics at the University of Stuttgart, with a broad range of interests spanning Robotics, Dynamics and Control, Solid Mechanics, and Optimization.
My academic journey began with a passion for Motorsports, which inspired me to pursue Mechanical Engineering, and has since evolved to blend a strong foundation in control systems, robotics and solid mechanics.

Currently, my research focuses on real-time state estimation under uncertainty and its integration into robust control strategies, particularly for experimental systems and autonomous applications. However, through my Masterâ€™s program (COMMAS), I have developed a rigorous understanding of continuum mechanics, engineering materials, computational mechanics, and machine learning methods.

You can find more details in my full CV below. PLease feel free to view my projects and research work, and do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations.
